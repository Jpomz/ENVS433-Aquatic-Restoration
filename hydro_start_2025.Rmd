```

## Overview

This tutorial covers:  
* Downloading flow data from USGS gauges  
* "Wrangling" the data into a more flexible format  
* Calculating basic hydrograph metrics  
  * Flow Duration Curves  
  * Annual Flood Frequency  
  * Empirical return intervals  
  * Estimating return intervals  
  
* Calculating some of the IHA metrics  

## Setup  

You will need to download the:  
* `dataRetrieval` and `tidyverse` packages  
* You only need to do this once per machine  
* copy the following code into your console and run it (press enter)  
  * Do **NOT** put this code into your script  


```{r setup, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("dataRetrieval")
install.packages("tidyverse")

```

## Start a new script  

Now that we have the packages installed, we can start a new script (white square with a green plus sign icon in the top left) and begin our analysis.  

### Load Libraries  

* Only need to install package once  
* Need to "load" it every time  

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dataRetrieval)
library(tidyverse)
```

### Download data  

* We will use the `dataRetrieval` package to download data  

* For a more complete tutorial on the `dataRetrival` package, [see this website](https://doi-usgs.github.io/dataRetrieval/index.html)  

* Here, we will download data from the USGS gauge on the Colorado River near the UT-CO stateline  

* Save variables to make download easier

```{r}

siteNo <- "USGS-09163500" #CO River near CO-UT stateline
# you will need to look up a site code for a different gauge for your assignment

pCode <- "00060" #discharge

# all daily data from 2003-2023
start.date <- "2003-10-01"
end.date <- "2023-12-31"
# For your assignment, make sure there is at least 10 yers of data, and change the dates as appropriate
```

* Now use the `read_waterdata_daily()` function to download the data, and save it as an object called `co_r`  

```{r}
co_r <- read_waterdata_daily(
  monitoring_location_id = siteNo,
  parameter_code = pCode,
  time = c(start.date, end.date))
```

* We can now print out that that data to see what it looks like:  

```{r}
# just first few rows:
co_r
# statistic_id == 00003 = daily
```

* You can also `View()` the whole thing with this code:  
* Note that the following does not run in this tutorial for visualization purposes, but I will do it in class.  
```{r, eval=FALSE}
View(co_r)
```

* This produces a data frame (table) with `nrow(co_r)` rows and `ncol(co_r)` columns  
* For our purposes, we only need the columns named:  
  * `time` : In this case, the date in YYYY-MM-DD format  
  * `value` which is the mean discharge (Q) for that day  
    * We will rename it to be `q`  
  * We could also keep the `unit_of_measure` column, bit it's always CFS, so we will just have to remember that  
* We also want to remove the "geometry attributes"  
  * Discussion of this is beyone the scope of this tutorial  
  
```{r}
# remove "geometry" attributes
attr(co_r, "class") <- "data.frame"

# overwrite co_r to just be the two columns
# and rename value column to be "q"
co_r <- co_r |>
  select(time, value)|>
  rename(q = value)
co_r
```


## Calculate Daily Flow Duration Curves  

Recall that a FDC is calculated as:  

$$
\text{% Exceedance} = \frac{m}{N+1}*10
$$

where $m$ is the rank of the flow, and $N$ is the number of observations in the data  

* Sort the flows so that the highest is the first row, and the smallest flows is the last row  

```{r}
daily_pe <- co_r |>
  # sort by the q column
  arrange(-q) |>
  # add a "rank" column
  mutate(m_rank = 1:n()) |>
  # calculate % exceedance
  mutate(PE = (m_rank / (n() +1)) *100)

# print out the new data object
daily_pe
```

* plot the Flow Duration Curve  
* x = percent exceedance (PE)  
* y = q  

```{r}
ggplot(daily_pe, 
       aes(x = PE, 
           y = q)) +
  geom_line()
```
* FDC's are usually plotted with a logarithmic y-axis  

```{r}
ggplot(daily_pe, 
       aes(x = PE, 
           y = q)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_y_log10()
```
* we can also add a title and axis labels for clarity  

```{r}
ggplot(daily_pe, 
       aes(x = PE, 
           y = q)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  labs(title = "Daily Flow Duration Curve",
       subtitle = "CO River near CO-UT stateline",
       y = "Flow (Q)",
       x = "Percent Exceedance")
```
